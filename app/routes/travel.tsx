        <h4>Fly into London Heathrow (LHR)</h4>
        <p>
          Flying into Heathrow is <i>usually</i> the cheapest option, but will
          require you to take either a bus or train to Cardiff. You can buy a
          really cheap bus ticket through{' '}

          . You can also opt to take a train which will get you there a bit
          quicker (roughly 2 hours). Tickets can be purchased from a variety of
          places online, I tend to use{' '}

          The bus can take anywhere from 3.5 to 4.5 hours. If you book a
          Megabus, you'll need to get from London Heathrow to Victoria station-
          this will be an additional cost. However, if you book a National
          Express, you'll be able to catch the bus directly from London Heathrow
          airport.
        </p>

        <h4>Fly into Bristol (BRS)</h4>
        <p>
          Flying into Bristol gets you slightly closer to Cardiff, but you
          likely won't find as many direct flights here. Similarly to London
          Heathrow, you can get either a train or bus to Cardiff. You can buy a
          really cheap bus ticket through{' '}

          From Bristol airport, it's roughly a 1.5 to 2.5 hour bus or train
          journey to Cardiff. If you opt for the train, you'll need to take a
          bus to get to from the airoprt regardless.
        </p>

        <h4>Fly into Cardiff (CWL)</h4>
        <p>
          Depending on where you're flying from, you're unlikely to find a
          direct flight into Cardiff- however, it will obviously require a
          shorter bus/train journey to get to the city centre. From the airport,
          there's a bus which charges less than Â£10 to get you to the city
          centre (takes less than 40 minutes). Depending on what date you're
          getting in, we may even be able to come pick you up from the airport
          if you let us know!
